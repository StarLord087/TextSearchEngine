1) Jaccard Coefficient based document retrieval: For each query, your system will output
top k documents based on jaccard score.
2) Tf-Idf based document retrieval: For each query, your system will output top k
documents based on tf-idf-matching-score. Implement different versions of Tf-Idf based
document retrieval then compare and analyze which performs better and why.
3) Tf-Idf based vector space document retrieval: For each query, your system will output
top k documents based on a cosine similarity between query and document vector.
